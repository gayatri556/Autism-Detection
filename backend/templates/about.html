  <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
    This autism screening tool is designed to help parents identify early signs of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in young children.
    It is powered by a machine learning model trained on real data and is intended to be used as a quick screening tool â€” not a diagnostic tool.
    <br><br>
    We believe in early intervention, education, and empowering caregivers with accessible, evidence-based tools.
